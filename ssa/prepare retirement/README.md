* Reduce field office call volume
* Give users the right information in the most efficient amount of time

[back to top](#top)

## <a name="users"></a>Who Are We Building For?
* Users planning for retirement and want an estimate of their benefits
* Users applying for retirement

## <a name="userJourney"></a>Current User Journey

1. Catalyst (birthday, friend, AARP mail) gets users interested in retirement
2. Googles 'plan for retirement' or some variation
3. Click ssa.gov link to start to create My Social Security account to get accurate estimate
4. Blocked from getting My Social Security account
5. Go to the retirement section of SSA
6. Tap 'Learn' although you don't want to learn because you came from an article where the information was condense for you
7. Don't actually find the calculator section because its pretty hard to find, instead you call the field office number

[back to top](#top)

## <a name="problem"></a>User Problems
* ~~I don't know how social security retirement works~~
* There are a lot of calculator options and I'm not sure which one to pick
* ~~I don't know what documents I'll need to get the information I'm looking for~~
* I can't log into My Social Security

## <a name="possibleScope">Possible Scope
* Small
  * Update prepare portion of the website to be more comprehensible
  * Make small updates to UI for current calculators and add analytics
  * Utilize existing calculators and make a flow from one calculator to another
* Medium
  * Update the prepare portion of the website to be more comprehendible
  * Build a benefits estimator to give a user a range estimate of what they should expect for their specific edge cases
* Large
  * Build a survey to check how a userâ€™s benefits are effected
  * Build a benefits estimator to give a user a ranged estimate of what they should expect for their specific edge cases


## <a name="outOfScope"></a>Out of Scope
* We shouldn't build a competitor to an estimator on the authenticated space or given by the field office.
* Authenticated Estimators
  * [Retirement Estimator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/estimator.html) - This requires authentication
  * [Detailed Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/anypia/anypia.html0) - It might not be out of scope, but I don't have enough time to dive into the calculator right now. We should follow up and see if we need to port this and add it to the backlog

## <a name="spouseBeneCalc"></a>[Benefits for Spouses](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html)

[https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/spouse.html)

**Users**
* Married or widowed
* Users who want to retire early

**Takeaways**
* UX
  * Fields are too small
  * No main call to action
  * calculator hidden on the page
* Tons of explanatory text that could most likely be explained differently or before a user gets to the calculator

**Next Steps**
* I have no idea how often this gets used
* I also am not sure if this should be an ad-hoc calculator or integrated into a larger calculator
* Do users only come here to check the effect early retirement would have on spouse benefits?

## <a name="gpoCalc"></a>[Government Pension Offset Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/gpo-calc.html)

[https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/gpo-calc.html](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/gpo-calc.html)

**Users**
* Government workers


**Takeaways**
* UX
  * Calculator is below the fold
  * Doesn't define what 'today's dollars' is
* Tons of extra information
  * Intro text
  * Why you might be exempt (ask the user and only show them if they need it!)
  * Documentation you'll need and explanations on what certain inputs will do to your benefit

**Next Steps**
* Again, we don't have metrics on this
* Seems like it could be useful as an ad hoc calculator if a user is trying to understand implications of their government pension

## <a name="lateOrEarlyCalc"></a>[Late or Early Retirement](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/early_late.html)
[https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/early_late.html](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/early_late.html)

**Users**
* Users who want to retire early or later

**Takeaways**
* There is a lot of explanatory text stating the effects of retiring early or later and the forumla for determining the reduction. Not sure if that is needed
* This might be for a slightly different audience - users who are slightly younger (50) and want to plan when they can go on retirement
* The results are not dynamic - it will be 90% of "primary insurance amount", but if a user is only coming here to see when they retire, they might not know how much that is
* UX
  * Small Fields
  * Results come back in a text box
  * Calculator is surrounded by text

**Next Steps**
* While this might be an ad hoc calculator, it needs more functionality to be useful.
* Possibly consider combining this with a benefits calculator or bridging from this calculator to a benefits calculator ("Want to estimate what 90% of your primary insurance amount? Continue to the next step and find out")

[https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/population/longevity.html)

**Users**
* Users starting down the path of planning for retirement, regardless of age
* Users who already made a plan for retirement but are confirming their life expectancy before committing to a decision

**Takeaways**
* Pretty simple calculator
* A good amount of text to explain the calculator

**Next Steps**
* I am not 100% sure if this would be better in another calculator or serves a purpose as an ad hoc calculator

## <a name="beneCalc"></a>[Online Benefits Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/AnypiaApplet.html) - Same as WEP Calculator
[https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/AnypiaApplet.html](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/AnypiaApplet.html)

**Users**
* A user who wants to get a more accurate look at what their retirement benefits will look like
  * Probably closer to retirement age
  * Willing to spend the extra time to enter in all of this information
  * What types of users use this calculator? How often?

**Takeaways**
* UX
  * Lots of call outs, warnings and text formatting :(
  * I guess the results are on the same page as the questions to allow users to go back and change their answer
  * I don't think the results should be displayed inside a text fieldbox
* How often do users use the 'inflated dollars' option? Is that needed?
* Do users really need to input all years of earnings? Isn't the benefit calculated based on the top 35 years of salary?

**Next Steps**
* Break these questions into multiple pages
* Don't distract the user with lots of warnings and technical text, let them input the information
* Should the authenticated calculator be linked to from here?

## <a name="quickCalc"></a>[Quick Calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/)
[https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/](https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/quickcalc/)

**Users**
* Users who want to quickly view their retirement benefit
  * Why? Do they not want to do the work in the 'Benefits Calculator' or are they getting a baseline to make a decision in their life?
  * What do users do with this information? Could we help them by making it easier to export?

**Takeaways**
* UX
  * Better than other calculators
  * "You must be at least 22 years old to use this form" - why is this worded so strongly?
* Still a lot of explanatory text
* On the results page, it also shows disability and survivor estimates. I'm not sure if this is in the target market.

**Next Steps**
* This should definitely be a separate calculator for users who want a quick estimate

**User**
* I'm not sure

**Takeaways**
* UX
  * Sigh
  * Result is a table of numbers that isn't very easy to digest

**Next Steps**
* Rework this entire calculator and combine it with something else
* This seems redundant

**User**
* A user who is working this year and eligible for retirement or survivors benefits this year

**Takeaways**
* The title for the calculator isn't descriptive
* If there is a reduction, there is a lot of explanation and calculation a user has to uncover


**Next Steps**
* Is there a way to make the calculation details more easy to understand?
* It asks for estimated earnings, but that could probably be something we could help discover
* Maybe have a different branch/section for people who want to do a early or late retirement

[https://ssabest.benefits.gov](https://ssabest.benefits.gov)

![Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool](images/BEST.png)

**Users**
* Users who want to get a general idea of what benefits they are eligible for

**Takeaways**
* This isn't in the calculator section, its on the 'Additional Information' sidebar on the 'Learn About Retirement' page
* "Oh, this is part of benefits.gov, that is why it's not on the SSA site and why it seems so much better"

**Next Steps**
* Look at this tool as inspiration

**Users**
* Anyone who is receiving a pension and has all of their earnings handy
* Users who can't access their My Social Security but still want a relatively accurate estimate of their benefits

**Takeaways**
* There is a block of form that contains 70+ text fields. If people are not receiving perfectly accurate information because it isn't what SSA has in the system, why would we want users to enter it in here?
* See [Benefits Calculator](#beneCalc)

**Next Steps**
* There is a sentence in here that states " If all of your pension income is covered by Social Security, you do not need to use this calculator and you can use the more straightforward Online Calculator instead." - well, we should only show the user this form _if_ they might be affected by WEP
* Is there a quicker way to access all of their earnings?

# <a name="prepare"></a>Notes from "Prepare for Retirement" web pages

## <a name="summary"></a>Prepare Summary
The current landing page has an explanation of how it works and eligibility and when you can retire. Its a lot of text and I think a lot of the text could be paired down or converted into explanatory images/infographics

It gets tricky when the page starts to talk about edge cases - military, farm work, self-employed, etc. There might be a small number of people who fit multiple cases, but I think for the majority of the users, we could show contextual information.

The next section talks about pensions, which aren't too complicated to understand, but Windfall Elimination Provision is pretty complicated - I still have no unpacked this portion. Again, we might not need to show this information if it is not pertinent to the user.

## <a name="pensionsAndWindfalls"></a>Pensions and Windfalls
**[Windfall Elimination Provision(WEP)](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/wep.html)**

## Personal Comments
* The [Working outside the US](https://www.ssa.gov/international/totalization_agreements.html) section gets a little messy and might not be necessary to add the eligibility from [international agreements](https://www.ssa.gov/international/status.html)
* This layout for 'other considerations' when planning retirement is actually a good breakdown of the checklists that a user needs to account for: [https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/otherthings.html?tl=0%2C1%2C2%2C3%2C4](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/otherthings.html?tl=0%2C1%2C2%2C3%2C4)
