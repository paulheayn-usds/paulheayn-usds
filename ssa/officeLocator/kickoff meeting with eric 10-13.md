# Notes

## Questions
1. Goals
  * What is SSA's primary goal with improving the office locator?
2. What is in scope?
  * How do field offices handle content controls (office closing, hours, wait times?)?
  * Focus on accessible data via ROOMS? Or plan to integrate third-party APIs (mapbox, city public data)
  * What is out of scope?
3. Stakeholder
  * How can I talk with local offices?
  * Which field offices might be the best to talk directly with users?
  * Who else do you recommend I talk with?
4. Strategy
  * Initial qualitative feedback on prototype
  * Build design MVP and user test it with users
  * Adjust feedback
5. Data
  * Do we have access to field office usage data?
  * How has the field office usage changed since the pandemic?  
  * Do we have access to analytics for the current office locator?
  * Do you have any studies or data conducted with the field office to understand what is needed from their end in an office profile?
  * On average, how much foot traffic does a field office bring in (pre-covid)?


## Answers
* Goals - What the customer wants - business- lots of offices, identified location from zip code, but its not the best way to identify closest office especially not in larger zip codes. ideally include mapping, locations themselves, we need to show address and basic information but certain service attributes and wait times
* Get users to office as quickly as possible. we've done our best with the website. Service strategy is web then phone then office. thats is our preference from business preference. In general drive people to online service
* We live in a time where people don't go to offices. eventually we'll go back to an office. if you are going to the office to get benefits, you will want to set an appointment.
* Look at bigger picture of service funnel and its just one step in a larger process.
* I want to apply but not self-service, i need to schedule interview - identifying location is part of that process. office locator could stand alone or it could be injected in the pack of service
* Not offices are created equally - some in city with no free parking, others with it. self-help PCs, not all offices have that. DOORS will have this information
* MVP will not have all items. Working with regions to get information on them to understand types of information
* Relying on customer feedback through agents, need to talk with customer
* Having a concept is more efficient than handing something
* DOORS can add attributes. In time scale, we can have some in there, but office wait time is a wish list item.
* User looking for office near me - it shows me wait time at a glance because it informs decision on which to pick.
* Talk to slyvie on regional offices
* Working on content controls - temporary controls but its not available now, with message and expecation for reopen
* Existing office locator has weird features - brings up other agencies with community service phone numbers - never discussed if it gets used or why
* Generalized web data but won't answer why - it should be tested
* We have details from the field in CBO - the office - can use them to be interviewed. Michelle and Ashley
* No one is going to field office - go to recruitment of someone who has used the office service channel - 'have you been to an office for an interview or other service need?'

* Data point - standard list of service offerings per office - parking, self-help pcs.  - all are full service, very few exceptions for card centers (nyc and philly only focusing on cards and name services)
* Have ZIPPER visitor intake - has wait times, but can't use that its not apples to apples - offices cue people differently - two stage cues - tick you and pull you in for quick assessment - second cue doesn't show in MI in other places you get a ticket and wait until you get an agent.
* Ping Eric.Christiansen@ssa.gov to get numbers on field office visits

* Change in office? Use the office to help people who need it the most and the most complicated. for everyone else use the self-service channels. We want to prioritize. We can't stop people from just walking in, we will always have to be full services. we are trying to make checkin process more consistent with consistently measured wait times. in the new model, we are doing away with check in kiosks. Our check in today, you indicate SSN, reason for business, if you have an appointment or not. We found our customers are very slow if they don't remember ssn or spend a lot of time selecting the correct service.
  * When offices open, there is a huge influx and do it for them, the manager can do it faster and can move people in larger status. rush in the morning means the models failed. removing kiosk from station and will have an agent and will do the way finding, assessing need. the experience in office will change and reopen
  * Experience will change but service won't
  * Mobile check in app that we were building out, where a customer can bring app up and identify service location and pre-check. im not sure what the status is right now or how it will integrate with it?
  * Email Sylvie about mobile app - Julius

* No limitations on API usage - DOORS data will join up with other data on flat file so anyone can ingest it. DOORS api can only be called by zip code. you'd have to find all adjustent offices. If we can export it all to flat file we can export it all to app and not worry about api calls.
* We can use apis but need to be mindful of contracts -
* There is arcGIS data which we have access to it, but we want consumer friendly mapping
* Google maps has usage limitations - when we start paying, we have to have a contract and need to compete for it.
* If open osurce data we can pull down to reference on our own
* Tom Nieslen, for justice 40 team,  for deep dive of mapping (federal tool that is free)

* Traffic - in last year field office average 1-1.4M/month. looks like it was going down and then spiked - back in 2011 it was 12-13M for the year, then started dropping 2019 it was down to 9M for the year
* Get to MI for secure apps. 1.19M Unique, on google its 1.2M unique, average time on page is 1m35s, 30% of customers exit from there
* 'Other agencies' link is used by 2% of customers average time on page is 4 minutes and 3 seconds
* On average probably searching 2 zip codes
* Search for folo - three tags, ifolo/officesearchandresults, otheragenciesinyourarea + error pages (?)
* Traffic is tagged and might be in google analytics
* Elisabeth Hanover - silvie can connect with her. she has been working on the office information effort. she is area manager in boston region. she might have more perspective from different level
