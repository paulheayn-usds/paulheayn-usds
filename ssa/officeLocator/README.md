# Office locator
Notes on redesigning the office locator with the data in the DOORS system

# TODO
* Talk with Eric about controls (who in the local offices should be able to adjust things
* Look at data (more than just office locator - time to get to office, time to get from parking to office business, when it closes)
* What data can we get for geolocation?
* What can we launch?
* When should we launch?
* Can we launch iteratively? How can we get close to that?
* What is currently there?

# Available Data

### Questions on data
* Does a user need to know the physical address and the mailing address?
*

# Competition

## Social Security

## Google Maps
![Google Maps Screenshot](images/googleMaps.png)
* Geomap with pins on offices near by
* pins have subheaders if the office is closing soon
* Tapping on it shows:
  * Image of office
  * Place name
  * star rating
  * number of reviews
  * Actions [directions, save, nearby, send to phone, share]
  * address
  * hours of business (and if opening/closing soon)
  * website
  * phone number
  * plus code (probably something for google)
  * Suggest an edit
  * Preview carousel of other offices

Email mike lin to see if there is access to lightweight user research

Field offices - check them out. eric did a session with them around identifying the fields of information that are needed for an office profile. there is a lot of information and data that is sitting with the field offices. their content needs - things they have to communicate in a profile type of way.

Andrea might be a good person to talk with about field office since she was in a meeting.

what data sources are available.
