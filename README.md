Previous to the USDS, I spent the majority of my time as a user-facing product manager focused on making people healthier through digital products. 
I was offered the opportunity to lead retention and growth at Lose It; launch ASICS Studio, an audio-based workout app; and improved engagement at Runkeeper. 
I am passionate about understanding users and their problems and joined USDS to learn from all of you and help an even larger population. 

In my free time, I coach my kids' lacrosse team, create cardboard castles, and build small apps.
